# OpenSCAD libraries

This repository only links to existing libraries via git submodules, it
does not host any library directly. For license and usage information
please refer to the upstream library repository.

In case the libraries have release versions, a number of versions are
available. The `main` link will go to the latest version in the external
repository, regardles of the branch name in that repository.

Currently this is mainly an experiment on how to structure library storage
for [Cadhub](https://cadhub.xyz/draft/openscad) or local usage.

Anyone interested in helping by adding more libraries or evolving it into
the direction of package management would be welcome to talk on the
[OpenSCAD IRC channel](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#openscad) (#openscad
at [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/)).
